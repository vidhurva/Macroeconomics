# Macroeconomics
This project incorporates content from Macroeconomics in Computer Science. 

I created a struct GDP which stores information on consumption, investment, government spending, exports and taxes. There is no need to include imports because the value of imports creates a positive value on either investment or consumption. Thus, the two amounts "cancel" the values to 0. Furthermore, I included a GDP calculator and a Private Savings calculator using a void function with structures. I will include later Macroeconomic concepts in my work.
