# Macroeconomics
This project incorporates content from Macroeconomics in Computer Science. 

Summary:

I created a struct GDP which stores information on consumption, investment, government spending, exports and taxes. There is no need to include imports because the value of imports creates a positive value on either investment or consumption. Thus, the two amounts "cancel" the values to 0. Furthermore, I included a GDP calculator, a Private Savings calculator, a Public Savings calculator and a National Savings calculator using a void function with structures. From the received quantitative data, the program includes if else statements to determine whether the government runs a balanced budget, budget deficit or budget surplus. 

How to conduct the program:
The program requires the user to submit the values of consumption, investment, government spending, exports and taxes. The programmed calculator and condition statements will perform the rest.
